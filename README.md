# cintel-05-cintel-fancy

A bit nicer looking live data example (using random, updating 1x/second)

Uses:

- Python Standard Libary Packages for fake live data (random, datetime)
- Python Standard Library Collections Package Deque for storing the last N readings
- A Python dictionary to hold each fake data reading (e.g. temperature and time)
- Pandas for data and display in preparation for charting
- PyShiny Express for building reactive apps for continuous intelligence
- UI: Sketches a possible layout
- UI: Adds a PyShiny Value Box with a Font Awesome Icon and 3 strings

## Try It in the Browser

Go to PyShiny Playground at <https://shinylive.io/py/examples/#basic-app>.
Copy and paste content from [dashboard/app.py](dashboard/app.py) and run.
The PyShiny Playground includes these packages already, so you won't need requirements.txt:

- <https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html#python-packages>

## Get the Code

Fork this project into your own GitHub account and/or just borrow code from app.py.
Clone your GitHub repo down to your local machine.
Use your GitHub **username** in place of denisecase and your GitHub **repo name** in place of cintel-05-cintel-fancy.
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) may work better on some machines.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/denisecase/cintel-05-cintel-fancy
```

## Run Locally - Initial Start

After cloning your project down to your Documents folder, open the project folder for editing in VS Code.

Create a local project virtual environment named .venv, activate it, and install the requirements.

When VS Code asks to use it for the workspace, select Yes.
If you miss the window, after installing, select from the VS Code menu, View / Command Palette, and type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select the .venv folder.

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands (for Windows - the activate command is slightly different Linux/Mac).

```shell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
shiny run --reload --launch-browser dashboard/app.py
```

Open a browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> and test the app.

## Run Locally - Subsequent Starts

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
.venv\Scripts\Activate
shiny run --reload --launch-browser dashboard/app.py
```

## After Making Changes, Export to Docs Folder

Export to docs folder and test GitHub Pages locally.

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "Terminal" / "New Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
shiny static-assets remove
shinylive export dashboard docs
py -m http.server --directory docs --bind localhost 8008
```

Open a browser to <http://[::1]:8008/> and test the Pages app.

## Push Changes back to GitHub

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "Terminal" / "New Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Useful commit message"
git push -u origin main
```

## Enable GitHub Pages (One-Time)

Go to your GitHub repository settings. 
Scroll down to the Pages tab.
Enable GitHub Pages from the **main** branch and from the **docs** folder and click Save.
Wait to see what you new URL is for the hosted app.

When it's ready, go to the About section of your GitHub repo and set the URL to your GitHub Pages site.
